# cousera_gettingData_project
This project for the assignment within coursera/JHU Data Science/Getting and Cleaning Data.
To be specific, the task is to collect, work with, and clean a data set from UCI regarding using the human activities data collected by smartphone. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## The project includes:
1) a tidy data set "MeanData.txt"
2) "CodeBook.md" a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
3) "run_analysis.R" script file which consists of five steps
* step1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* step2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* step3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* step4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* step5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
4) and also this "readme.md" file
